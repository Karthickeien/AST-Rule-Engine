# AST-Rule-Engine
This repository contains a simple 3-tier rule engine application designed to determine user eligibility based on various attributes such as age, department, income, and spending. The system leverages an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent conditional rules, allowing for the dynamic creation, combination, and modification of these rules.
